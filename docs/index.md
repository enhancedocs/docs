## Who is EnhanceDocs for?

EnhanceDocs is a versatile tool that caters to a diverse range of users. Here are some of the key groups that can 
benefit from EnhanceDocs:

### Teams of Developers

Developers working in teams often have to manage extensive documentation for various projects. EnhanceDocs helps 
streamline this process by providing an efficient and user-friendly search engine that allows developers to quickly find 
relevant information, minimize errors, and improve collaboration.

### Open Source Communities

Open source communities thrive on collaboration and sharing of knowledge. EnhanceDocs empowers these communities 
to easily navigate and extract valuable information from their documentation, fostering a more productive and supportive 
environment for contributors and maintainers alike.

### Companies

EnhanceDocs alleviates this problem by providing a natural language approach to searching documentation, making it 
easier for employees to find the information they need. By reducing the reliance on subject matter experts for 
information retrieval, EnhanceDocs allows companies to save time, improve efficiency, and ensure that their valuable 
documentation is fully utilized.

## Getting started

### EnhanceDocs Managed

We recommend using [EnhanceDocs Managed](../managed) with free tier to get started fast. We have a free tier plan up to 1.000 requests / month
which tends to be sufficient for most projects, and if you are running it on an open-source project our Pro plan is FREE.
For both cases simply [sign up](https://app.enhancedocs.com/sign-up), we take care of the rest.

### EnhanceDocs Self-hosted

Alternatively you can run EnhanceDocs Server on your own. Following the [Getting started](./category/getting-started) guide.
