# Introduction to EnhanceDocs

EnhanceDocs is the AI-powered search engine for your documentation.

We enable communities and development teams by providing context search on documentation!

Curious to know how it works in action? Just give a search on this site! This site is powered by EnhanceDocs Search!

Not convinced by our example? Check [this other](https://enhancedocs.github.io/chroma-docs/) out from chroma open-source vector database

## Our support to the open-source community

Open-source is the foundation of Software as we understand it today, and without open source we ourselves wouldn't exist!

If you are an active maintainer or contributor of an open source library and would like to implement EnhanceDocs in your project documentation
we have a FREE licence for you!

Please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AUDa3KZavw) to change your licence type and for support if you need to implement on your site!
