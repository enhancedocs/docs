# Overview

Integrations are tools and services that connect with **EnhanceDocs** to complement and extend your workflow.

You can find and set up all available integrations in your [Organization settings](https://app.enhancedocs.com/settings/integrations).

Remember to configure your CD pipelines to build and push your documentation before integrating with Discord or Slack.
You can see how to do it [here](../getting-started/configure-cd).
