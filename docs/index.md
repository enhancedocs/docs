# Introduction to EnhanceDocs

EnhanceDocs is the open-source AI-powered search engine for your documentation.

We enable communities and development teams by providing context search on documentation!

Curious to know how it works in action? Just give a search on this site! This site is powered by EnhanceDocs Search!

Not convinced by our example? Check [this other](https://wix-incubator.github.io/obsidian/) out from obsidian the dependency injection framework for React and React Native applications.

## Getting started

### EnhanceDocs Managed

We recommend using [EnhanceDocs Managed](../managed) with free tier to get started fast. We have a free tier plan up to 1.000 requests / month
which tends to be sufficient for most projects, and if you are running it on an open-source project our Pro plan is FREE.
For both cases simply [sign up](https://app.enhancedocs.com/sign-up), we take care of the rest.

### EnhanceDocs Self-hosted

Alternatively you can run EnhanceDocs Server on your own. Following the [Getting started](./category/getting-started) guide.
