# Integrating with your Slack channel

Learn how integrate EnhanceDocs in any Slack workspace of your preference. Easily search through your Slack workspace to get all the information you need.

## Prerequisites

Configure your CD pipelines to build and push your documentation before integrating with Slack.
You can see how to do it [here](../getting-started/configure-cd).

## 1. Add EnhanceDocs App to your Slack channel

First we would need authorize the EnhanceDocs Slack App to be in your Slack workspace.

To authorize Slack App go to [Organization settings](https://app.enhancedocs.com/settings) > [Integrations](https://app.enhancedocs.com/settings/integrations)
from your EnhanceDocs Dashboard. Click on the Slack integration and follow the oauth2 flow and selecting the workspace and channel you wish to install.

## 2. Start using it ðŸš€ðŸš€

Now you are done with the setup! Give it a try by asking the EnhanceDocs Slack App a question in your preferred channel.
e.g.: `/enhancedocs Who are you?`

<div align="center" style={{ margin: '24px 0' }}>
  <img src={enhancedocsSlackExampleUrl} alt="EnhanceDocs Slack App Example" width="500" style={{ borderRadius: 16 }} />
</div>
