# Introduction

To create integrations, retrieve data, and automate your workflows, use the EnhanceDocs GraphQL API.

## About the GraphQL API

The EnhanceDocs GraphQL API offers flexibility and the ability to define precisely the data you want to fetch.

## Why EnhanceDocs is using GraphQL

EnhanceDocs chose GraphQL for our API because it offers significantly more flexibility for our integrators.
The ability to define precisely the data you want—and only the data you want—is a powerful advantage over the REST API. GraphQL lets you replace multiple REST requests with a single call to fetch the data you specify.

## Overview
